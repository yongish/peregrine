# Peregrine take-home prompt

## Getting started

Runs with no dependencies, requires python 3.

Example usage:

```
python main.py
python main.py --models case vehicle --properties year:2008
python main.py --properties first_name:ben,elise last_name:lopez
python main.py --properties year:2008
```

Zhiyong's note: I assume that we can replace "null" with "None".
I did not have time to handle the case where there are no models.

**See assignment PDF for further requirements.**
